##need to learn how to convert inches to cenimeters and pounds to kilograms
my_heights = 72 #inches
cenimeters_in_a_inch = 2.54
print("my height in cenimeters is", my_heights * cenimeters_in_a_inch, "cenimeters tall")

###Works as variables

kilograms_in_a_lb = 2.20462
my_weight = 175 #lbs
print(f"my weight in kilograms is {my_weight}*2.20462 =, kilograms")

##doesn't work as strings
